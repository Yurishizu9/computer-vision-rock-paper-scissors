## Milestone 2

> Creating computer vision system

This does not relate to [~~Milestone 1~~](#milestone-1). Using [Teachable-Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) I made an image project model and imported it to the repository. Then I exported and downloaded the model as a TensorFlow model with the Keras conversion type.
